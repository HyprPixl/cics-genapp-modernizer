# CICS GenApp Modernizer – Agentic Documentation Report

![Initial topology](base/images/initial_topology.jpg)

## Mission Overview
- Documented the GenApp modernization workspace end-to-end, establishing a repeatable agent workflow for legacy analysis.
- Produced shared knowledge artifacts (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT_PROCESS.md`) and a dependency graph CLI to capture relationships as work progresses.
- Completed the five-phase plan spanning transactional COBOL modules, data services, shared assets, ops tooling, and simulation data.

## Timeline of Activities
1. **Bootstrapping** – Created `AGENTS.md` for ongoing notes and reauthored the repository `README.md` with layout, workstreams, and open questions.
2. **Phase 1 (Core Transactions)** – Documented add/inquiry flows for policy and customer workloads (`LGAPOL01`, `LGAPVS01`, `LGAPDB01`, `LGACUS01`, `LGACDB01`, `LGACVS01`, `LGICUS01`, `LGICDB01`, `LGIPOL01`, `LGIPDB01`).
3. **Phase 2 (Data Services)** – Captured supporting DB2/VSAM services and logging utilities (`LGACDB02`, `LGUCDB01`, `LGUCVS01`, `LGUPDB01`, `LGUPVS01`, `LGSTSQ`).
4. **Phase 3 (Shared Assets)** – Summarized copybooks (`LGCMAREA`, `LGPOLICY`, `POLLOOK`, `POLLOO2`) and BMS mapset `SSMAP.bms` to illustrate commarea reuse and screen alignment.
5. **Phase 4 (Ops & Automation)** – Indexed key JCL members, REXX tailoring scripts, and `install.sh`, clarifying how host datasets and compile pipelines are provisioned.
6. **Phase 5 (Data & Simulation)** – Documented dataset seeds, WSIM customer journey scripts, and `Transaction_Counters.evbind` for telemetry capture.
7. **Process Capture** – Authored `AGENT_PROCESS.md` describing the agentic workflow for reuse and onboarding.

## Key Artifacts
- **README.md** – Central knowledge base with program notes, shared asset summaries, ops tooling, and data/simulation coverage.
- **AGENTS.md** – Chronological progress log marking completion of each phase and highlighting dependencies for hand-offs.
- **AGENT_PROCESS.md** – Narrative overview of the methodology suitable for onboarding or stakeholder briefings.
- **tools/dep_graph.py + dependency_graph.json** – CLI plus datastore for maintaining the evolving dependency map.
- **REPORT.md (this document)** – Executive summary with visual context and timeline.

## Dependency Graph Snapshot
```bash
./tools/dep_graph.py list --type cobol
./tools/dep_graph.py show LGAPDB01 --include-dependents
```
- Graph tracks COBOL modules, DB2 tables, VSAM clusters, datasets, REXX/JCL utilities, event bindings, and simulation assets.
- Enables incremental updates as future agents document additional modules (`LGDPDB01`, `LGSTS*`, etc.).

### Visualization Capabilities
The dependency graph tool now includes comprehensive visualization features:

```bash
# Generate complete system overview
./tools/dep_graph.py visualize --output full_dependency_graph.png

# Focus on COBOL programs only
./tools/dep_graph.py visualize --filter-type cobol --output cobol_graph.png --show-labels

# Analyze database relationships
./tools/dep_graph.py visualize --filter-type db2-table --output db2_graph.png

# Custom sizing and layouts
./tools/dep_graph.py visualize --width 20 --height 16 --layout hierarchical
```

**Generated Visualizations:**
- `full_dependency_graph.png` - Complete system with all 43 nodes and 89 dependencies
- `cobol_dependency_graph.png` - COBOL programs (19 nodes) showing program relationships  
- `db2_tables_graph.png` - Database schema visualization (7 tables)
- `copybook_graph.png` - Shared copybook structures (3 components)

**Graph Statistics:**
- **Total Components:** 43 nodes across 14 different types
- **Dependencies:** 89 directed relationships 
- **Most Referenced:** LGCMAREA copybook (used by 19 components)
- **Most Complex:** LGAPDB01 (depends on 9 different components)
- **Component Types:** COBOL (19), DB2 tables (7), copybooks (3), VSAM files (2), REXX scripts (2), datasets (2), and others

## Outcomes & Benefits
- **Transparency** – Every major component now has a succinct description, interfaces, and error-handling notes.
- **Traceability** – Dependency graph exposes cross-program relationships for modernization planning.
- **Parallelization** – Roadmap identifies streams that multiple agents can pursue simultaneously.
- **Operational Insight** – Ops artifacts and simulation scripts are catalogued, shortening ramp-up for test runs.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Extend documentation to remaining COBOL modules (delete/update flows `LGDP*`, test harness programs) using the established template.
2. Populate dependency graph with CPSM/JCL relationships and external services as they are reviewed.
3. Leverage WSIM scripts to validate transaction documentation and update notes with observed runtime behavior.
4. Engage stakeholders to confirm modernization objectives (API enablement, UI refactors) and map them onto documented components.
