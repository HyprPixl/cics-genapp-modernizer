# Agentic Documentation Session Summary

## Objective
- Establish a repeatable approach for agents to document and understand the CICS GenApp Modernizer codebase.
- Produce shared artifacts (notes, README structure, dependency graph) while recording the workflow for future handoffs.

## Activities Completed
1. **Kickoff & Workspace Prep**
   - Created `AGENTS.md` to act as the shared activity log and guidance hub.
   - Drafted a new `README.md` outlining repository layout, documentation workstreams, immediate questions, and next steps.

2. **Initial Program Deep Dive**
   - Reviewed `base/src/LGAPOL01.cbl` (add-policy front-end) and captured purpose, interfaces, dependencies, and error paths in the README.
   - Logged the same findings in `AGENTS.md` so other agents can see progress and outstanding follow-ups.

3. **Tooling for Dependency Tracking**
   - Built `tools/dep_graph.py`, a CLI for maintaining a JSON-based dependency graph (`dependency_graph.json`).
   - Seeded the graph with `LGAPOL01` and its dependencies, providing usage instructions in `AGENTS.md`.

4. **Workflow Planning**
   - Produced a phased documentation roadmap in `AGENTS.md`, highlighting serial vs. parallel tracks to keep multiple agents productive.
   - Committed and pushed updates to ensure the shared plan is versioned.

5. **Backend & VSAM Coverage**
   - Analysed `base/src/LGAPVS01.cbl` (VSAM writer) and `base/src/LGAPDB01.cbl` (DB2 inserter), documenting each module in the README and progress log.
   - Expanded the dependency graph with VSAM cluster `KSDSPOLY`, DB2 tables, copybooks, and supporting programs.

6. **Version Control Hygiene**
   - Grouped work into logical commits and pushed to `origin/main` after each milestone to keep history clear for collaborators.

## Resulting Artifacts
- `README.md`: living repository guide with structured program notes and modernization workstreams.
- `AGENTS.md`: chronological progress log, dependency notes, tooling instructions, and phased plan.
- `tools/dep_graph.py` + `dependency_graph.json`: lightweight dependency management system for ongoing analysis.
- `AGENT_PROCESS.md`: this summary for pitching the agentic documentation approach.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Continue Phase 1 by pairing remaining customer-facing programs with their data services while updating the graph.
- Assign parallel tracks (copybooks/maps, operations tooling, data/simulation assets) per the roadmap to accelerate coverage.
- Use the dependency tooling during each review cycle to keep relationships current and traceable.
