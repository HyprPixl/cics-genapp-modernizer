# CICS GenApp Modernizer

## Overview
- Modernization workspace for the IBM CICS GenApp sample application and supporting assets.
- Contains legacy COBOL programs, JCL procedures, REXX utilities, and data used to simulate the insurance workload.
- Goal: inventory and document the moving parts before proposing upgrades or refactors.

## Repository Layout
- `base/src/` legacy sources: COBOL programs (`lg*.cbl`), copybooks (`*.cpy`), BMS maps (`ssmap.bms`), and supporting text assets.
- `base/cntl/` JCL members for compiling programs, allocating datasets, and driving GenApp jobs.
- `base/exec/` REXX execs invoked during build or operations (`cust1.rexx`, `mac1.rexx`).
- Customer Experience Assets: `base/wsim/` workstation simulator flows, `base/event-bindings/` CICS event bindings, and `base/images/` reference diagrams.
- `base/bin/` utilities, notably `install.sh`, to allocate host datasets and upload members via `tsocmd` and USS `cp`.
- `base/data/` sample input datasets (`ksdscust.txt`, `ksdspoly.txt`) referenced by the application.

## Documentation Work Breakdown
- Legacy Programs: walk each `lg*.cbl` module, record purpose, entry points, and copybook usage.
- Shared Copybooks & Maps: describe `*.cpy` data structures and `ssmap.bms` screen definitions.
- Operations JCL: map every member in `base/cntl/` to its function (compile, bind, housekeeping, etc.).
- Automation & Tooling: review REXX execs and `install.sh` for deployment or setup automation.
- Data & Simulation Assets: capture how `data/` and `wsim/` files drive scenarios or tests.
- Platform Integrations: document `event-bindings/` artifacts and any external dependencies.

## Legacy Program Notes
### LGAPOL01 â€“ Add Policy Transaction
- Purpose: front-end CICS task for creating a new insurance policy; validates commarea length before delegating persistence to `LGAPDB01`.
- Interfaces: expects `DFHCOMMAREA` shaped by `LGCMAREA` (minimum 28-byte header plus request payload) and initializes `CA-RETURN-CODE` to `00` on entry.
- Dependencies: `LGAPDB01` (database insert), `LGSTSQ` (TDQ error logging), `LGCMAREA` copybook for shared structures, CICS commands (`LINK`, `RETURN`, `ASKTIME`).
- Error Handling: abends with code `LGCA` when no commarea provided; writes timestamped diagnostic entries via `LGSTSQ` and echoes failing commarea payload.
- Follow-ups: document `LGAPDB01` data-handling logic and confirm expected commarea layout for policy adds.

## Immediate Findings & Questions
- `install.sh` expects `tsocmd` and USS `cp` with dataset support; confirm environment prerequisites.
- Customer experience assets hint at established monitoring and test flows; identify current owners.
- Need to verify whether source members align with current CICS region configuration.
- Images folder currently holds `initial_topology.jpg`; consider exporting architecture notes from there.

## Next Steps
- Inventory high-priority COBOL transactions first (e.g., customer inquiry vs policy update paths).
- Decide documentation template for program deep-dives; store drafts alongside `AGENTS.md` notes.
- Align with operations to validate JCL sequencing before running in target environment.
- Capture modernization goals (e.g., API enablement, refactoring) once stakeholder input arrives.
