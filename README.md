# CICS GenApp Modernizer

## Overview
- Modernization workspace for the IBM CICS GenApp sample application and supporting assets.
- Contains legacy COBOL programs, JCL procedures, REXX utilities, and data used to simulate the insurance workload.
- Goal: inventory and document the moving parts before proposing upgrades or refactors.

## Repository Layout
- `base/src/` legacy sources: COBOL programs (`lg*.cbl`), copybooks (`*.cpy`), BMS maps (`ssmap.bms`), and supporting text assets.
- `base/cntl/` JCL members for compiling programs, allocating datasets, and driving GenApp jobs.
- `base/exec/` REXX execs invoked during build or operations (`cust1.rexx`, `mac1.rexx`).
- Customer Experience Assets: `base/wsim/` workstation simulator flows, `base/event-bindings/` CICS event bindings, and `base/images/` reference diagrams.
- `base/bin/` utilities, notably `install.sh`, to allocate host datasets and upload members via `tsocmd` and USS `cp`.
- `base/data/` sample input datasets (`ksdscust.txt`, `ksdspoly.txt`) referenced by the application.

## Documentation Work Breakdown
- Legacy Programs: walk each `lg*.cbl` module, record purpose, entry points, and copybook usage.
- Shared Copybooks & Maps: describe `*.cpy` data structures and `ssmap.bms` screen definitions.
- Operations JCL: map every member in `base/cntl/` to its function (compile, bind, housekeeping, etc.).
- Automation & Tooling: review REXX execs and `install.sh` for deployment or setup automation.
- Data & Simulation Assets: capture how `data/` and `wsim/` files drive scenarios or tests.
- Platform Integrations: document `event-bindings/` artifacts and any external dependencies.

## Legacy Program Notes
### LGAPOL01 – Add Policy Transaction
- Purpose: front-end CICS task for creating a new insurance policy; validates commarea length before delegating persistence to `LGAPDB01`.
- Interfaces: expects `DFHCOMMAREA` shaped by `LGCMAREA` (minimum 28-byte header plus request payload) and initializes `CA-RETURN-CODE` to `00` on entry.
- Dependencies: `LGAPDB01` (database insert), `LGSTSQ` (TDQ error logging), `LGCMAREA` copybook for shared structures, CICS commands (`LINK`, `RETURN`, `ASKTIME`).
- Error Handling: abends with code `LGCA` when no commarea provided; writes timestamped diagnostic entries via `LGSTSQ` and echoes failing commarea payload.
- Follow-ups: document `LGAPDB01` data-handling logic and confirm expected commarea layout for policy adds.

### LGAPVS01 – Policy VSAM Persistence Helper
- Purpose: writes policy summary records into VSAM KSDS `KSDSPOLY` after `LGAPDB01` allocates a policy number.
- Interfaces: consumes `LGCMAREA` to drive record keys/segments; expects `CA-REQUEST-ID` to provide policy type discriminator (`C`, `E`, `H`, `M`).
- Dependencies: VSAM file `KSDSPOLY`, `LGSTSQ` for TDQ logging, `LGCMAREA` copybook, CICS file control APIs.
- Error Handling: non-normal `RESP` results set `CA-RETURN-CODE` to `80`, log failure via `LGSTSQ`, and return without abend to allow caller control.
- Notes: ensures commarea snapshots go to TDQ on failure, preserving the request data used to build the record image.

### LGAPDB01 – Policy Database Writer
- Purpose: core add-policy back-end that inserts rows across DB2 tables before invoking `LGAPVS01` for VSAM replication.
- Interfaces: requires `LGCMAREA` payloads matching add-policy templates (`01AEND`, `01AHOU`, `01AMOT`, `01ACOM`); includes SQL copybook `LGPOLICY` for host variable definitions.
- Dependencies: DB2 tables (`POLICY`, `ENDOWMENT`, `HOUSE`, `MOTOR`, `COMMERCIAL`), `LGAPVS01` (post-insert VSAM sync), `LGSTSQ` for logging, `LGCMAREA`, `LGPOLICY` SQL include, CICS DB2 commands (`EXEC SQL`), and TDQ infrastructure.
- Error Handling: translates SQLCODEs into GenApp return codes (`70`, `90`), logs details through `LGSTSQ`, and abends with `LGSQ` on downstream table failures to trigger unit-of-work backout.
- Notes: fetches generated policy number via `IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL()` and updates commarea so caller can return the new identifier.

### LGACUS01 – Add Customer Transaction
- Purpose: front-end CICS task for creating a new customer record; validates commarea structure before delegating persistence to `LGACDB01`.

- Dependencies: DB2 `CUSTOMER` table, `LGACVS01` (VSAM sync), `LGACDB02` (customer security), named counter `GENACUSTNUM` from pool `GENA`, `LGSTSQ` for logging, `LGCMAREA` copybook.
- Error Handling: handles counter unavailability by using DB2 `DEFAULT` for customer number assignment; translates SQLCODEs to return code `90`; logs SQL requests and results.
- Notes: attempts to obtain customer number from CICS named counter first, falls back to DB2 identity generation; updates commarea with assigned customer number.

### LGACVS01 – Customer VSAM Writer
- Purpose: writes customer summary records into VSAM KSDS `KSDSCUST` after `LGACDB01` processes DB2 customer insertion.
- Interfaces: consumes `LGCMAREA` customer data starting from `CA-Customer-Num`; expects 225-byte customer record format.
- Dependencies: VSAM file `KSDSCUST`, `LGSTSQ` for TDQ logging, `LGCMAREA` copybook, CICS file control APIs.
- Error Handling: non-normal file `RESP` results set `CA-RETURN-CODE` to `80`, log failure details via `LGSTSQ`, and abend with `LGV0` to preserve transaction integrity.
- Notes: uses customer number as both record key and starting field; ensures diagnostic data includes RESP/RESP2 codes for file operation troubleshooting.

### LGICUS01 – Inquire Customer Transaction
- Purpose: front-end CICS task for retrieving customer information; validates commarea structure before delegating lookup to `LGICDB01`.

- Notes: requires commarea length to accommodate both header/trailer (18 bytes) plus customer data structure from `LGPOLICY` copybook.

### LGUCUS01 – Update Customer Transaction  
- Purpose: front-end CICS task for updating customer details; validates request ID and delegates modification to `LGUCDB01`.
- Interfaces: expects `DFHCOMMAREA` shaped by `LGCMAREA` with request ID `01UCUS` and customer update payload; initializes return codes on entry.
- Dependencies: `LGUCDB01` (database update), `LGSTSQ` (TDQ error logging), `LGCMAREA` copybook for shared structures, CICS commands (`LINK`, `RETURN`, `ASKTIME`).

## Shared Data Structures

### LGCMAREA – Core Communication Area Copybook
- Purpose: unified DFHCOMMAREA structure defining data exchange format for all GenApp transactions; provides consistent layout for customer and policy operations across front-end and back-end services.
- Structure Overview: 32,500-byte commarea with 18-byte header (request ID, return code, customer number) plus 32,482-byte request-specific payload supporting multiple data variants.
- Header Fields:
  - `CA-REQUEST-ID` (6 chars): transaction discriminator (`01ACUS`, `01ICUS`, `01UCUS`, `01APOL`, `01IPOL`, `01UPOL`, `01DPOL`, etc.)
  - `CA-RETURN-CODE` (2 digits): operation result code (`00`=success, `70`=DB2 error, `80`=VSAM error, `90`=SQL error, `98`=length error, `99`=invalid request)
  - `CA-CUSTOMER-NUM` (10 digits): customer identifier for policy operations and linkage
- Data Variants:
  - `CA-CUSTOMER-REQUEST`: customer data layout (first/last name, DOB, address, contact details, policy count, nested policy data area)
  - `CA-CUSTSECR-REQUEST`: customer security layout (password hash, retry count, state flags)
  - `CA-POLICY-REQUEST`: policy data layout with common fields (issue/expiry dates, broker info, payment) plus type-specific sections
- Policy Type Sections:
  - `CA-ENDOWMENT`: life insurance data (with-profits flag, fund details, term, sum assured, life assured name)
  - `CA-HOUSE`: property insurance data (property type, bedrooms, value, house name/number, postcode)
  - `CA-MOTOR`: vehicle insurance data (make, model, value, registration, color, engine size, manufacture year, premium, accident history)
  - `CA-COMMERCIAL`: business insurance data (address, coordinates, customer info, property type, peril/premium pairs for fire/crime/flood/weather)
  - `CA-CLAIM`: claims data (claim number, date, paid/value amounts, cause, observations)
- Usage Patterns: included via `COPY LGCMAREA` in LINKAGE SECTION of all transaction programs; referenced as `DFHCOMMAREA` parameter; field access via dot notation (`CA-REQUEST-ID`, `CA-POLICY-COMMON.CA-ISSUE-DATE`, etc.)
- Dependencies: consumed by all front-end transaction programs (`LGACUS01`, `LGICUS01`, `LGUCUS01`, `LGAPOL01`, `LGIPOL01`, `LGUPOL01`, `LGDPOL01`) and backend services (`LGACDB01`, `LGACVS01`, `LGAPDB01`, `LGAPVS01`).

### LGPOLICY – DB2 Host Variable Copybook  
- Purpose: DB2 interface definitions providing host variable structures and length constants for policy-related database operations; ensures consistent field mapping between COBOL programs and DB2 tables.
- Length Constants: `WS-POLICY-LENGTHS` section defines field and record sizes for validation and buffer allocation across policy types.
  - Core lengths: Customer (72), Policy (72), Endowment (52), House (58), Motor (65), Commercial (1102), Claim (546)
  - Full record lengths: Endowment (124), House (130), Motor (137), Commercial (1174), Claim (618) including headers
  - Summary lengths: Endowment summary (25) for abbreviated displays
- DB2 Structure Mappings:
  - `DB2-CUSTOMER`: maps to CUSTOMER table fields (name, DOB, address, contact details)
  - `DB2-POLICY`: maps to POLICY table with common policy attributes (type, number, dates, broker, payment)
  - `DB2-ENDOWMENT`: maps to ENDOWMENT table fields (investment options, term, sum assured, life assured)
  - `DB2-HOUSE`: maps to HOUSE table fields (property details, value, location)
  - `DB2-MOTOR`: maps to MOTOR table fields (vehicle specs, value, registration, premium, claims history)
  - `DB2-COMMERCIAL`: maps to COMMERCIAL table fields (business address, coordinates, peril coverage, status)
  - `DB2-CLAIM`: maps to CLAIM table fields (claim details, amounts, cause, observations)
- SQL Integration: included via `EXEC SQL INCLUDE LGPOLICY END-EXEC` in DB2-enabled programs; provides host variables for INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT operations; supports parametric queries and result set mapping.
- Data Type Handling: uses COBOL `PIC` clauses matching DB2 column definitions; numeric fields use `COMP` for binary storage; character fields support varying lengths; padding fields accommodate DB2 row size requirements.
- Usage Patterns: referenced in SQL statements as `:DB2-POLICY.DB2-ISSUEDATE`, `:DB2-CUSTOMER.DB2-FIRSTNAME`, etc.; lengths used for dynamic allocation (`MOVE WS-FULL-MOTOR-LEN TO WS-REQUIRED-CA-LEN`); structure mapping for data movement between commarea and DB2 host variables.
- Dependencies: consumed by all DB2-enabled backend services (`LGACDB01`, `LGAPDB01`, `LGICDB01`, `LGIPDB01`, `LGUCDB01`, `LGUPDB01`) and some front-end programs requiring field length validation (`LGACUS01`, `LGICUS01`, `LGIPOL01`).

## Immediate Findings & Questions
- `install.sh` expects `tsocmd` and USS `cp` with dataset support; confirm environment prerequisites.
- Customer experience assets hint at established monitoring and test flows; identify current owners.
- Need to verify whether source members align with current CICS region configuration.
- Images folder currently holds `initial_topology.jpg`; consider exporting architecture notes from there.

## Next Steps
- Inventory high-priority COBOL transactions first (e.g., customer inquiry vs policy update paths).
- Decide documentation template for program deep-dives; store drafts alongside `AGENTS.md` notes.
- Align with operations to validate JCL sequencing before running in target environment.
- Capture modernization goals (e.g., API enablement, refactoring) once stakeholder input arrives.
